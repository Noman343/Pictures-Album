                Flowers did not always exist; they first appeared 140 million years ago. ... </li>
            <li>Several centuries ago in Holland, tulips were more valuable than gold.        </li>
            <li>Broccoli is actually a flower.        </li>
            <li>Some plants such as orchids do not need soil to grow-they get all of their nutrients from the air.        </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>
            "Flowers usually attract us towards their splendour and nature. They give us happiness and amusement even
            if they are protected with sharp thorns. They convey a sensation of freshness and soften our hearts when 
            we are unhappy and drained. They cleanse our environs and uplift our life when we are feeling sad."
